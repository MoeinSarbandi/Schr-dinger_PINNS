# Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the Schrödinger Equation

## Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`PINN_Schrödinger_Eq.ipynb`) dedicated to solving the Schrödinger Equation using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The Schrödinger Equation is central to quantum mechanics and describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes over time. This project leverages the power of PINNs to model and solve this complex equation, demonstrating an innovative intersection of physics and deep learning.

## Installation
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For plotting and visualization.
- `torch`: For implementing and training the neural network model.

You can install all required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn torch
